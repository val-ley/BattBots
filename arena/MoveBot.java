Class: MoveBot

A bot that will allow you to test moves

    /*
    This method is called at the beginning of each round. Use it to perform
    any initialization that you require when starting a new round.
     */
    public void newRound() {
    }

     /**
     This method is called every cycle by the BattleBotArena to find out what you want your Bot to do.
     The legal moves are defined in constants in the BattleBotArena:

        Move your bot at BOT_SPEED set in BattleBotArena:
            BattleBotArena.STAY
            BattleBotArena.UP
            BattleBotArena.DOWN
            BattleBotArena.LEFT
            BattleBotArena.RIGHT

        The Fire moves cause a bullet to be created (if there are
        not too many of your bullets on the screen at the moment). Each bullet
        moves at speed set by the BULLET_SPEED constant in BattleBotArena.

        Fire:
            BattleBotArena.FIREUP
            BattleBotArena.FIREDOWN
            BattleBotArena.FIRELEFT
            BattleBotArena.FIRERIGHT
       
        The SEND_MESSAGE move (if allowed by the Arena) will cause a call-back
        to this Bot's outgoingMessage() method, which should return the message
        you want the Bot to broadcast. This will be followed with a call to
        incomingMessage(String) which will be the echo of the broadcast message
        coming back to the Bot  

        Messaging:
            BattleBotArena.SEND_MESSAGE
   
    Parameters:
    me       A BotInfo object with all publicly available info about this Bot
    shotOK   True iff a FIRE move is currently allowed
    liveBots An array of BotInfo objects for the other Bots currently in play
    deadBots An array of BotInfo objects for the dead Bots littering the arena
    bullets  An array of all Bullet objects currently in play

    Returns:
    must return a legal move (use the constants defined in BattleBotArena)
     */

    to make sure your images are loaded before you will use them.
